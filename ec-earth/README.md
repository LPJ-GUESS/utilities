# EC-Earth

# Prerequisits:

Matlab or Octave and a version of guess-utils (to be added..!)

# A simple LPJ-GUESS analysis tool for the EC-Earth community

Need to have all three files in the same folder, have matlab installed (set to tetralith matlab in lpjg_fast_analysis.sh at the moment) and have LPJ-GUESS standard tools installed (aslice and tslice, installed on tetralith)

# Usage: lpjg_fast_analysis.sh <PATH_TO_RUNDIR> [-o < OUTPATH>] [-r <REFPATH>] [fwah]

PATH_TO_RUNDIR: should be to the level rundir/exp-name/output/lpjg

# Options:
  -r --reference       <PATH> to a dir with aggregated LPJG reference run (should timewise overlap with current run)
  
  -o --outdir          <PATH> to store output in, DEFAULT='./'
  
  -f --force_aggregate -> do exactly that, in case a previous aggregation has failed...
  
  -w --overwrite       if outdir exists force overwriting of analysis data
  
  -a --aggregate_all   aggregate the full set of LPJG output files
  
  -h --help            help
